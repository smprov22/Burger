This is an Application that lets you Devour some burgers with the help of Node.js/Express/MySQL/Handlebars/Bootstrap.  The app was created using MVC layout and homemade ORMs.

This is a simple full stack application with a front end implemented by HTML/CSS/Bootstrap and the help of Handlebars. The backend is implemented with Node/Express/MySQL.

The user can either add a burger to the menu using the form at the bottom, or devour one of the burgers currently ready for eating.  When a burger is added to the "Ready to Eat" menu, it is also added to the MySQL database. When a burger is devoured, the burger moves to the right side of the screen under the "Already Eaten" field.  The database is also updated with the new status of that eaten burger.
